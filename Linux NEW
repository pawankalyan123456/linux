1)To set the username and password that never experies :: chage -M -1 user
2)/etc/passwd and /etc/shadow cannot merge in same file because it has the username and password of the user in it for security reasons
3)to list number of file opened by particular pid :: lsof -p PID
4)unable to mount the filesystem what is the reasons?
  >we might be in the same directory >if some user are present in that directory and usingits content :: fuser -cu /dev/sda >if some of the files are open in that directory :: lsof /dev/sda
5)what could be the reason if server taking more time :: might be the filesystem was corrupt and ext2 doesnt have journaling feature
6)we trying to create the file under any partition but we are getting permission denied and there is no permission issue or disk issue :: inode is full (df -i > df -i /ftpusers/)
7)How to check kernel routing table info :: route -n or netstat -rn or ip route
8)what is stickybit and difference btween s and S :: its the special permission given to file or directory ,even if any user have full permission they cant delete the file or directory
  only owner or root have permission to delete it >> symbolic way :: chmod o+t /opt/dump/ or chmod +T /OPT/dump/, >> Numericway :: chmod 1757 /opt/dump/, >> setuid :: chmod 4700 executable
  >>s is setuid and execuitable & S is setuid and non exexcuitable.
9)whch file is used to specify the default gateway :: /etc/sysconfig/network
10)In RHEL how to switch between 2 run levels :: who -r (to get the runlevels) to change systemctl isolate runlevel3.target (or) systemctl set-default mulri-user.target(or)
   systemctl get-default >>0)halt,1)single-user mode,2)not used(user defined),3)full multi-user mode,4)not used,5)full multi-user graphical mode,6)reboot.
11)NFS : network file system which is used share the files and directries to others over a network.port number 2049, install nfs-util package and create a directory and export the directory
   by editing /etc/exports using (exportfs) commond now restart the service and make it permanent in /etc/fstab file. now set the nfs client configure:: intsall nfs-util and list the mount 
   exported using (showmount) commond.make dir and mount the nfs.
12)Nice value :: Its setting priority of the process.valus from -20 to 19 >> nice -n -1 pid , nice -n 19 commond.
13)ftp : file transfer protocol , portnumber 20,21, it uses TCP protocol, its heaver than tftp
   tftp: trivial file transfer protocol , portnumber 69, its based on UDP , its light weight.
14)how to extend the filesystem in linux  :: logical volume management, >>lvextend -L +1G /dev/data_vgO1/data_lvO1 after thhis need to ressize >>resize2fs /dev/data_vgO1/data_lvO1
15)How to roll back the updated patch :: yum install vsftpd >> yum history >> yum history info 8 >> yum history undo 8.
16)rsync :: its used for backingup/mirroring the directory tree of file from one server to other server,keeping two machines in sync. {rsync -rv -e ssh /data 192.162.1.10:/root/}
17)reduce the size of filesystem and this cont be done online :: df -h to check the lv space >>unmount lv >> organize the data using, e2fsck -f /dev/data_vgO1/data_lvO1>>
  update the filesystem using,resize2fs /dev/data_vgO1/data_vlO1 >> now reduce the size using, vlreduce -L -200M /dev/data_vgO1/data_vlO1
18)Uptime commond shows the loadaverage of the system in three values in time period of 1min,5min,15min,(1.05,.07,5.90) the load sshould not exceed over 1 check the process
  which is running for long time or which is not terminated after execution.
19)how to set the numbering of the file >> :se nu
20)how to scan the disk in linux :: echo "---" /sys/class/scsi_host/host0,host1/scan
21)/etc/fstab file having how many fields :: 6 fields >device name >mount point >type of FS >mount option >dumping >checking sequence
22)soft link :: can be created accross the partition, inode number will be different between the link and sourec< if original file deleted link will not be accessed
              its like a shortcut file >>ls -s <sourcedir> <destination>
  Hard link :: cant be created accross the partition,inode number is same, if original file deleted also we can access the data ,its like a backup 
             >>ln <sourcedir> <destination>
23)what is the location of NFS shared info :: /etc/fstab
24)How to check if any particular port is listening or not :: netstat -anp | grep 80
25)du -sh * >> du :: its used to know the disk usage of sum on file in a directroy 
   df -h >> df :: used to know the disk space of the filesystem
26)journaling :: its the dedicated are in the filesystem which tracks all the changes, bcz of this filesystem corruption is less.
   (journalctl -xeu docker)
27)if one package is not allowing to do patching >> rpm -ivh vsftpd --nodeps
28)Linux Booting Process >> BIOS basic output stream which search for boot loaders and executers and system integerity chceks
  >>MBR master boot loader which has 512bytes which located in /dev/sda or /dev/hda.
  >>GRUB its the splash screen shows multiple kernel if its installed /boot/grb/grub.conf
  >>KERNEL mount the root file system as specified as ROOT in grub.conf,,,it executes /sbin/init
  >>initrd (intial ram disk) its a temperory rootfile system ,until the kernel is booted and real file system is mounted.
  >>init and looks at /etc/inittab desiceds the linux on which runlevl to 
29)what is w commond  :: its the builtin tool which gives the info about ehich user is loggedin ,
  jcpu > total runtime of all process attached to the user , PCPU > elapsed time for the users current process.
30)RPM : rehat packaage manager , YUM : yellowdog updater modified
   >rpm -qa vstpd, rpm -qa --test (to install particular package), rpm -ivh (to check package is consistent or not),yum list installed
31)ACL how to apply  :: Access control list ,it provides the fine grained access for directries and files for particular users.
  >create partition and format it with ext4file system, mount a file with ACL.
  >getfacl <option> <file/directort> options: -d display default ACL, -R recurses into subdirectries.
  >setfacl <agrument> <option> <file/directory> oprions:-m modify, -x remove ACL, -R recurses
32)INODE : df -i /dev/sda1, ls -i <file>
33)crontab -e :*min,*hours,*day of months,*month,*day in week
34)In prod everonment if any server reboot automatically or done by someone how will u troubleshoot 
   >last reboot | less or var/log/acpi or /var/log/{messages,syslog,dmesg}
35)commond to change the user password expire limit : chage -E date <username>
36)commond to extract the tar file : tar -xvft file.tar | grep filename
37)commond to check the memory : free -g or free -m
38)commond to see the architecture of linux : uname -a
